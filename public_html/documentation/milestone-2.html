<h1>PWP Milestone Two</h1>
<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<h3>Navbar</h3>
<p>The navigation bar will list links to each type of project showcased in the portfolio section: Ruby, HTML/CSS,
    JavaScript, and Python. It will collapse for mobile view.</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This section will begin with a headline giving a brief introduction, similar to a resume summary. Following this, a
    paragraph with a short bio.</p>
<h3>Portfolio</h3>
<p>Four sections, one for each project. The Ruby project section will include a video walkthrough. There will also be
    sections for an HTML/CSS project, a JavaScript project, and a Python example, with screenshots of the page or code
    examples. All sections will have a paragraph describing the purpose and goal of the project. On mobile view, the
    visuals will stack on top of the explanatory text, and on desktop they will sit side by side.</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>This will be a contact form following the portfolio section that sends a message to my email. There will also be a
    sticky footer at the bottom of the page with links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.</p>
