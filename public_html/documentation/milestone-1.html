<h1>PWP Milestone One</h1>
<h2>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This portfolio website is for showcasing projects I've made with both frontend and backend technologies. It will display
a variety of skills I've developed and can be hired to do more of. </p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>The audience for this website consists of potential employers and clients who are looking for a fullstack developer.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>My website should make it easy for someone looking to hire a web developer to see the kinds of things I can do for them.
Whether a visitor needs a simple website coded up from a design or a web app, they will find examples of similar projects
and some detailed information about them. The site should also make it easy for visitors to get in contact with me to
discuss possibilities for working together.</p>
<h2>Persona</h2>
<h3>Name</h3>
<p>Mike Q. Wiggin</p>
<h3>Role</h3>
<p>Senior Developer, Team Lead</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Mike is conversant with all operating systems, but prefers to use Windows. He has an Android phone for work and an
iPhone for his personal life.</p>
<h3>Behaviors and Attitudes</h3>
<p>Mike is often short on time, because his day-to-day job includes a lot meetings. A lot of meetings. Too many. This
schedule doesn't leave him with a lot of time to work on his own code, much less debug others' code.</p>
<h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
<p>The company Mike works for is growing and he needs more people on his team. He's having some trouble finding
    applicants because most of the developers in his immediate network are already employed or too busy with other
    projects. So he's having to reach out through his extended network to vet potential candidates he isn't already
connected with.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Mike is looking for a fullstack developer. His role keeps him busy, so he needs to quickly determine that a developer
he's considering is able to build the frontend of a website and write backend code. He needs to find someone who will be
able to work well independently as well as with the team of established developers.</p>
<h3>User Story</h3>
<p>As a hiring manager, I need to find out if a potential candidate has the skills I'm looking for.</p>
